# HTML/CSS/Git: Code Refactor - Horiseon

## Description

This project is a practice of refactoring Horiseon's existing code, making it more readable and well-structure. Also, improve Horiseon's webpage to be more accessible.  

[Checkout my final project on Github Pages](https://ryantrian.github.io/Horiseon-Refactoring-Challenge/)

### Challenges

1. I was having trouble understand the difference between `<div`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. Eventually I decided to settle with `<section>` because when I heard `<article>`, I imagine a blog post, while div is not semantic element.
2. Try to find a way that the text not squish together and spill out of the box when a browser's size become smaller according to user's wish. Unfortunately, it will require more understanding of styling, and positioning in CSS.

If you have advice / answer on the above, please feel free to contact me

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
